# XState mapping

## What is it?

Just a little repository where I play with **XState** in a mapping scenario where I want to map 
some **articles** with the right **category**.

## What do I use?

- Vite with React
- XState
- Fastify

## How to run?

If you want to run it locally, make sure you have installed the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Then you can run the front and back servers with the following command:

```bash 
yarn start
```

Otherwise, you can run the front and back servers separetely with:

```bash
yarn dev
yarn server:dev
```
